<h2>Category #1: Taste</h2>

<p>Sprite has a pretty basic flavor, and at face value it doesn't seem to be anything special. However this somewhat milquetoast taste is part of the reason many enjoy it.
While it is not bold or crazy, it has sticking power. Unlike darker sodas it's not very hard for even the most sugar sensitive individual to finish a whole can.
In my personal experience, it's not uncommon to open the can, take a few sips and suddenly realize you've finished the whole thing. Without trying to sound preachy or 
Assume anything about our dear reader, this taste is often off putting to those who expect more. It is however pleasant to the veteran drinker.
<br>Because of this at first boring, but pleasant and unassuming flavor, Sprite receives a 3/5 for taste.</p>

<h2><br>Category #2: Mouth Feel</h2>

<p>The mouth feel of Sprite is something to behold. Sometimes it feels like the carbonation is going to rip out your throat, and yet it feels amazing.
It's something I've yet to feel in drinking any sodas other than ginger ale. If ever there was a reason to drink Sprite it would be this, but it's hard to
convey the feeling through words alone.
<br>For mouthfeel, Sprite receives a 5/5. It's absolutely fantastic and definitely the main reason many enjoy the soda.</p>

<h2><br>Category #3: Nutrition</h2>
<p>One thing is for sure when it comes to nutrition, it's not great. We would even go on to say Sprite is very unhealthy, and if you do choose to drink it you
should enjoy it sparingly. This being said, it is not the worst soda in terms of sugar. While the 44 grams per serving is pretty steep, cream soda and root beer tend to have about 49 grams on
average. so if you're looking for an alternative to one of these two, Sprite is the slightly healthier option.
<br>For nutrition, I will be giving Sprite a 1/5. There is nothing to gain from drinking it aside from sugar, but it also is not the worst option out there. </p>

<h2><br>Category #4: Accessibility</h2>
<p>Sprite, much like most mainstream sodas is available in most grocery and corner stores. As well you can get it on tap from most restaurants. There isn't much to say
on this, as it's clear that if there are people, there is Sprite.
<br>Sprite gets a score of 5/5 for availability. You can really buy it pretty much anywhere.</p>

<h2><br>Category #5: Cost</h2>
<p>Sprite, much like any other commercially available soda is nothing more than carbonated sugar water. You would think this would make it super cheap to buy,
but the price is marked up astronomically at most retailers. stores have been seen charging as much as 6$ to 7$ for a 12 pack of cans. This is honestly outrageous.
It really is a testament to its' marketability, and dare we say addictiveness that the Coca Cola corporation can get away with this highway robbery.
<br>For cost, Sprite receives a score of 3/5. While it is frustrating that the price is so high for such a low cost beverage, this seems to be a problem across
the board when it comes to carbonated beverages. The blame can hardly be put solely on Sprite when this seems to be a problem deep within the institution.<br></p>

<h2><br>Final Score:</h2>
<h2>3.4/5</h2>
<p>Overall, Sprite receives a score of 3.4/5. While the taste and especially mouthfeel are quite something, we cannot in good faith give it anything higher than this score
what with all the problems it comes with. I will say however that other sodas would rate much lower if we were to rate them, and that if we choose to drink a soda
it tends to be a Sprite.<br>
This product review has been in no way influenced by Coca Cola. However if they would like to reach out to us, we will always accept free stuff.</p>
